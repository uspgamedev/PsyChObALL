Important
	- Finish last 2 levels
	- Refactor EVERYTHING
		- Redo score/level/allotherstats saving -- Almost done
	- Change 4-3 ending -- Almost Done
	- Refactor Continues

Bugs
	- Error "AL lib: ReleaseALC: 1 device not closed" ?
	- Death Effects sometimes do not reassemble correctly -- possibly fixed
	- Survival
		- When you kill a ball, sometimes its image does not disappear for some time
	- Tutorial does not initiate correctly the first time
		- Has to save "played it before" >>when you enter the tutorial the first time<<
		- Tutorial has to appear the first time whether you choose survival or adventure mode



TODO for next version:

	- New music (on the way)
	- On death special kind of ultrablast(if its not your final life):
		- Circle expands x pixels from psycho, killing everything (or damaging in case of bosses) and then retreats.
		- Balance x
	- HIGHSCORE MENU
		- New menu that shows your adventure highscore for each part -- btw awesome highscore stuff so far yan, well done
		- Shows your best total score on survival and how far you went on that run
		- Shows survival highscore
		- I cant rearrange the design later, just trie to show everything if possible
		- In survival mode, on highscore shows only Total highscore
		- On practice mode change "Score" text to "Area Score" and "High Score" to "Area High Score" and then shows your best socre for that area.
		- For now, lets make practice not save your area highscore, its just for practice.
	- Continues
		- Can use how many continues you can (for now)
		- If you use 1 or more continues you cant go to the final level
		- If you use 2(maybe 3) or more continues you cant go in the 5th level
		- They reset your score and bring you the beggining of the level -- done actually
