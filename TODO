TODO for next version:
	- Brainstorm about
		- New enemies, formations, boss behaviors for Levels 5 and 6
	- New main music (on the way)
	- New secundary music (aka boss music(aka my secret project I was doing))
		-Make possible to play a different song when a boss comes, possibly a sound effect when the exclamations are flying (will be a mp3 file as well) and resume main music on next level
	- Continues
		- No limits for number of continues
		- If you use 1 or more continues you cant go to the final level
		- If you use 2(maybe 3) or more continues you cant go in the 5th level
	-Concentrate mode (holding shift) makes Psycho smaller (to the size of the actual hitbox)
