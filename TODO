Important
	- Finish last 2 levels
	- Refactor EVERYTHING
		- Redo score/level/allotherstats saving -- Almost done
	- Refactor Continues

Bugs
	-	When cooshing a level on practice, fading out of the main is weird and sudden
	- Error "AL lib: ReleaseALC: 1 device not closed" ?
	- Tutorial does not initiate correctly the first time
		- Has to save "played it before" >>when you enter the tutorial the first time<<
		- Tutorial has to appear the first time whether you choose survival or adventure mode

Probable's
	- On death special kind of ultrablast(if its not your final life):
		- Circle expands x pixels from psycho, killing everything (or damaging in case of bosses) and then retreats.
			- Balance x
	

TODO for next version:
	-CONTROLLER SUPPORT
	- Add scrolling text to "Area High Score" on practice
	- On boss 1, instead of an exclamation mark to sinalize the change between his phase 1 and 2, just make him grow and reduce a bit (while doing that becomes invunerable, maybe with shades of gray that then 		go out to be the next color)
	- Brainstorm about
		- New enemies, formations, boss behaviors for Levels 5 and 6
	- New main music (on the way)
	- New secundary music (aka boss music(aka my secret project I was doing))
		-Make possible to play a different song when a boss comes, possibly a sound effect when the exclamations are flying (will be a mp3 file as well) and resume main music on next level
	- Continues
		- No limits for number of continues
		- If you use 1 or more continues you cant go to the final level
		- If you use 2(maybe 3) or more continues you cant go in the 5th level
	-Concentrate mode (holding shift) makes Psycho smaller (to the size of the actual hitbox)
