Important
	- Finish last 2 levels
	- Refactor EVERYTHING
		- Redo score/level/allotherstats saving -- Almost done
	- Refactor Continues

Bugs
	- Stat Screen/adventure screen
		-game crashes on entering both
	- Error "AL lib: ReleaseALC: 1 device not closed" ?
	- Death Effects sometimes do not reassemble correctly -- possibly fixed
	- Survival
		- When you kill a ball, sometimes its image does not disappear for some time (something to do with it not being 'removed' from the spriteBatch)
	- Tutorial does not initiate correctly the first time
		- Has to save "played it before" >>when you enter the tutorial the first time<<
		- Tutorial has to appear the first time whether you choose survival or adventure mode

Probable's
	- On death special kind of ultrablast(if its not your final life):
		- Circle expands x pixels from psycho, killing everything (or damaging in case of bosses) and then retreats.
			- Balance x
	

TODO for next version:
	- Brainstorm about
		- New enemies, formations, boss behaviors for Levels 5 and 6
	- New main music (on the way)
	- New secundary music (aka boss music(aka my secret project I was doing))
		-Make possible to play a different song when a boss comes, possibly a sound effect when the exclamations are flying (will be a mp3 file as well) and resume main music on next level 
	-MENU SCROLLING
		-Make someway that text that remains from one menu to the other doesnt scroll (i knwo this will be a bit hard, but its worth it)
			-Example:on practice, if you scroll to the side, the title practice and ht ebutton back should remain stationary
			-Where to do this for now:
				-Practice screen:title,"back", possibly the arrows (I know it will be harder since each has a different "command", but try, I believe in you and your magical programming skills)
					-(make so that once you click it already becomes the next "set of arrows")
	- Continues
		- No limits for number of continues
		- If you use 1 or more continues you cant go to the final level
		- If you use 2(maybe 3) or more continues you cant go in the 5th level
	-Implement a code to activate quickly all stages on practice while we are developing...
	-Concentrate mode (holding shift) makes Psycho smaller (to the size of the actual hitbox)
	-On practice, on the end the ability to press "r" and restar the area (for quickreload)
