Important
	- Finish last 2 levels
	- Refactor EVERYTHING
		- Redo score/level/allotherstats saving -- Almost done
	- Change 4-3 ending -- Almost Done
	- Refactor Continues

Bugs
	- Error "AL lib: ReleaseALC: 1 device not closed" ?
	- Death Effects sometimes do not reassemble correctly -- possibly fixed
	- Survival
		- When you kill a ball, sometimes its image does not disappear for some time (something to do with it not being 'removed' from the spriteBatch)
	- Tutorial does not initiate correctly the first time
		- Has to save "played it before" >>when you enter the tutorial the first time<<
		- Tutorial has to appear the first time whether you choose survival or adventure mode

Maybe's
	- On death special kind of ultrablast(if its not your final life):
		- Circle expands x pixels from psycho, killing everything (or damaging in case of bosses) and then retreats.
		- Balance x
	

TODO for next version:
	- Brainstorm about
		- New enemies, formations, boss behaviors for Levels 5 and 6
	- New music (on the way)
	- Continues
		- No limits for number of continues (for now)
		- If you use 1 or more continues you cant go to the final level
		- If you use 2(maybe 3) or more continues you cant go in the 5th level
